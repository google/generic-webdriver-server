# Xbox One UWP Container Application Template

This is a template for a UWP app for Xbox One.

It contains XAML files with C# code-behinds, and has only one primary component,
which is a WebView pointing to some specific destination.  The application is
almost entirely UWP boilerplate generated by Visual Studio.

The MainPage.xaml file will be overwritten with a specific URL before being
built and deployed to the Xbox One device.
